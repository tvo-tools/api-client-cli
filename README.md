# questions

- is there an opportunity?
  - command line automated acceptance tests API client to collect API use cases with the following features
    - offline and CLI first
    - Automated acceptance tests are written in plain language. Because they're written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because anyone can read them, they help improve communication, collaboration and trust in your team. ðŸ’–
    - testable design for workflow/scenarios/use cases 
    - security built-in
    - collect use cases for API

# why

- I need a simple way to run postman-collections, bru or simply collections of curls from the command line
- simple domain language to store collections
- stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language to save information about API requests.
- You can use Git or any version control to collaborate over your API collections.
- offline-only. There are no plans to add cloud sync, ever. We value your data privacy and believe it should stay on your device. Read our long-term vision here

- So here is what we do not want to do
  - We don't want to sell the project (get acquired)
  - We don't want to add/support cloud sync

- Here is what we want to do
  - Build a sustainable project that can last for decades
  - Build a community of users and contributors

- Some projects that have done it right
  Shoutout to Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel, and Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS. They have been a huge inspiration and have shown that you can build a sustainable open-source project without raising VC funding or selling it.
