# why

- I need a simple way to run postman-collections from the command line
- simple domain language to store collections
- stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language to save information about API requests.
- You can use Git or any version control to collaborate over your API collections.
- offline-only. There are no plans to add cloud sync, ever. We value your data privacy and believe it should stay on your device. Read our long-term vision here

- So here is what we do not want to do
  - We don't want to sell the project (get acquired)
  - We don't want to add/support cloud sync

- Here is what we want to do
  - Build a sustainable project that can last for decades
  - Build a community of users and contributors

- Some projects that have done it right
  Shoutout to Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel, and Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS. They have been a huge inspiration and have shown that you can build a sustainable open-source project without raising VC funding or selling the project.
